Here's a short explanation on how to use Java-Battleship:
Use java Battleship to run the code.
When the application starts, you, the player, will place 4 of their ships on a ocean 10 by 10 grid, by typing in the on-screen coordinates and orientation.
The game involves two grids(player and computer) positioned in. 
A player will place 4 of their ships on a ocean 10 by 10 grid. 
A computer will place 4 of their ships on another ocean 10 by 10 grid.
Then, the computer will place 4 of their ships on another ocean 10 by 10 grid.
You play against the computer by guessing its ships' locations.
NOTE: The computer's board is printed on screen, just so the game can go faster.
The program ends when either the player or computer has no ships left.
